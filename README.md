# Web Scraper AI

This project is designed to scrape websites and retrieve relevant information based on user prompts. It integrates **Streamlit** for the frontend, **Selenium** for web scraping, and **LangChain** for leveraging large language models (LLMs) to parse and process the data.

## üöÄ Features
- **Web Scraping:** Extract data from websites efficiently using Selenium.
- **LLM Integration:** Utilize LangChain to interact with LLMs for data parsing and analysis.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with Streamlit for a simple and intuitive frontend experience.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x** installed on your machine.
- **Google Chrome Browser** (for Selenium compatibility).
- **Ollama** installed (for LLM model management).
